# CSE185_Group44
Implementing Jellyfish command to generate a table for kmer counts.

The tool will count the number of kmers in A DNA sequence. The user will be able to specify the desired length of the kmer as an  input to  output and count the number of kmers that meet that desired kmer length, for the kmer counting function itself. There is an option to ignore strand directionality while counting number of kmers. Additionally, the tool will be more precise by filtering out low-frequency kmers. The tool takes a fasta file as an input and outputs a text file containing the kmer counts and their respective names.


How to Run:
1) Make a copy of the JellyFish Command Team.py file and run it in a Jupyter Notebook.
